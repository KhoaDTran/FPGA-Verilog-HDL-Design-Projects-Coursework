# FPGA Verilog HDL Design Projects and Coursework
## Coursework and projects regarding the design of field programmable gate arrays (FPGA) model applications in System Verilog Hardware Description Language at the University of Washington

### Design of Digital Circuits and Systems:
Provides knowledge, theoretical background, and experience practicing with tools and techniques for design/modeling complex digital systems with SystemVerilog hardware description language, as well as concepts of maintaining signal integrity, managing power consumption, and ensuring robust intra- and inter-system communication. Labs are complex projects imposing combinational and sequential logic design on programming algorithms, various audio, signals, and controller drivers. 

### Digital Circuits and Systems:
Overview of digital computer systems through concepts of logic, Boolean algebra, combinational and sequential circuits and logic design; programmable logic devices; and the design and operation of digital computers, including ALU, memory, and I/O. Last project is design of a tug of war game between two players on FPGA in SystemVerilog HDL, displaying current state of game and score with user inputs.
